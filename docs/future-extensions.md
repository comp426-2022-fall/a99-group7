# Future Extensions

## Add Liked Artists, Genres, Albums, etc. 
We hope to add more features to the user profile to provide a more complete representation of each user's music taste. Users will be able to add and remove these components similar to how they are currently able to for liked songs. We also hope to include images to go with some of these components. 

## Profile Statistics 
We hope to show a user the breakdown of the music they listen to. For example, we would like to display a pie chart showing the distribution of a users' most listened to music genres. 

## "Add Friends" Feature 
To truly make this a social platform, we want to allow users to add their friends and follow their profiles. A user will be able to view another user's profile and the other users that the user is friends with. 

## User Matching
We want to help people form meaningful bonds over music. To do that, we want to add a feature that helps pair users with other users in the area that have similar music tastes. This can be both in the form of a list of recommended users as well as a more personalized matching form. Users can fill out a form to share more about their personality and music preferences. Users can scroll through the forms of other users and view/follow their profile. We hope to include a chat feature that allows users to easily communicate with each other. 

## Compatible UI for More Devices
Currently, our website works best on a laptop. However, we hope to develop this web app to be a more compatible app for mobile devices and make it more accessible.
