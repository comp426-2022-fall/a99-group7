# Planning

## Meeting #1
Before our first meeting, we all brainstormed ideas for the final project. We began the meeting by sharing our initial ideas. Eventually, we decided we wanted to create a platform that allows people to connect with each other over music. We then looked into APIs that would allow us to collect information from Spotify and sketched out what we wanted the final product to look like. Images of the sketches we drew are included in the docs folder. We then assigned roles to each member of the group and divided the work. 

Following the first meeting, we continued to communicate over text to update each other about the progress we made. This was our primary mode of communication throughout the project. We also used the Project Board to keep track of our tasks. Most of the work was done asynchronously, but we met throughout the process as needed for progress check-ins and to discuss future steps. 

## Meeting #2
In our second meeting, we met in-person to go over the progress made on the backend of the website. The backend, including the login functionality and creation of databases to keep track of user information and logs, were nearly complete. After reviewing the progress, we adjusted each of our tasks and deadlines. 

## Meeting #3
Before the third meeting, we completed the frontend of the website. In this meeting, we reviewed the project guidelines again to check that we met all the requirements. We made note of tasks that still needed to be completed and assigned new tasks to each member. 

## Meeting #4
In our final meeting, we met over Zoom to record our project demo. After we completed the recording, we went over the last few tasks and devised a plan to complete the project.
